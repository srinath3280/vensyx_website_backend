["To address regressive test automation of software, QTP acts as a functional support in executing the tests. It is an automated graphical user interface testing tool which allows automation of web or customer-based computerized application. The test procedure of QTP is carried by VBscript. This scripting language of QTP specifies a testing procedure that helps manipulate and control the applications under tests. This tool identifies objects, application user interface and helps carry out desired changes. It generally follows key word driven approach. QTP have three types of recording modules, context sensitive, analog and low level.",{"Context sensitive:":"It is a basic default type of recording wherein the objects in the application are recognized regardless of the location. Once the object gets recorded in the application, the desired action gets performed on them."},{"Analog:":"QTP tracks and records every moment of the mouse when dragged around the screen. In analog module the tracks recorded can be stored in the directory of the tests. Analog recording can be done, relative to screen and relative to window. In the case of single window, the user can stick to relative screen. In the case of multiple windows, user can opt for relative windows."},{"Low level:":"Low level records are coordinate-based. A user uses low level recording if the test automation is precise to specific coordinates. It records every object of the application irrespective of QTP recognizing it or not. This consumes much of the disk space."},{"QTP services include:":["Test script models","Test object models","Test data designing","Analyzing the checkpoints","QTP data recording","Keyword driven frameworks","Debugging and script enhancements","Script maintenance"]},"The advantage of QTP is unlike other automated testing tools; QTP offers excellent recovery options through which the tests can be run through the point it stopped due to some accidental failure."]
