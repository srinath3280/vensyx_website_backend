["Manual testing is the oldest and most meticulous method of testing software wherein the testers do not use any automated tools. In this process, a tester manually works on the software testing for errors and defects before delivering it in the market. It is a tedious job and consumes a lot of time to completely check every single software.","Even though the tester tries to filter all the errors, there remains a chance of defects in the software. Manual testing functionality and accuracy is less countable when compared to automated test tools. The testers cannot meet the changing schedules and deadlines of the clients.","The tester need not have any knowledge of testing tool for manual testing software. Manual testing is considered a preliminary test that should be considered as an important test step before going for test automation. Even with advanced testing options, a tester has to adopt this basic model to depict minor errors in the development stage.","In manual testing a tester creates a test plan and executes the process. The main aim of manual testing is flawless software and its applicability. A tester makes sure while testing that the software has been designed to meet customer specific requirements.","Once the testing starts, the designed test cases and scenarios are tested by the tester. The difference between the actual and expected results are analyzed, compared and reported as defects. The ultimate goal of a tester is to deliver software of good quality to gain customer satisfaction. Manual testing has more draw backs than benefits. Manual testing cannot be done under multiple gateways. In manual testing, hidden information cannot be written using any program. In performing manual testing, the tester needs great concentration and patience.",["Acceptance testing","Integrated testing","Black box testing","White box testing","Unit testing","System testing"]]
